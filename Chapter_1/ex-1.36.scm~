;; Exercise 1.36
;;
;; QUESTION A: Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of its approximations using the
;; newline and display primitives. 

(define tolerance 0.00001)
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? a b)
    (< (abs (- a b)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (display guess) ; for each try, print it.
    (newline) 
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? next guess)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
