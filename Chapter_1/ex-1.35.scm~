;; Exercise 1.35
;; QUESTION: Show that phi is a fixed point of the transformation x: (1 + 1/x), and use
;; this fact to compute phi using the fixed-point procedure.
;;
;; The fixed-point procedure is given:

(define tolerance 0.00001) 
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? x y)
    (< (abs (- x y)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? next guess) ; if (f x) is close enough to x, return (f x)
          next
      (try next)))) ; else test (f (f x))
  (try f first-guess))
