;; QUESTION: Average damping y -> x/y^2 will give the cube root, just as average damping
;; y -> x/y converges on the square root. But finding the fixed point of the quartic root requires
;; average damping twice (i.e., (avg-damp (avg-damp f))). 
;;
;; Do some experiments using fixed-point, average-damp, and repeated to derive a generalized procedure
;; to compute n-th roots with the map of y -> x/y^(n-1).
