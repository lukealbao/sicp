SICP
====

Just a place to hold SICP exercises. There is no guarantee, of course, that I'll do them all -- and most likely I won't even commit every one I do. 

Please note: these are my solutions. In case you stumbled across this looking for solutions, I can't guarantee that they are correct, but I will try to note those which I *believe* are correct.


The full text of SICP, course notes, and video lectures can all be found here:
